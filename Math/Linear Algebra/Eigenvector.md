Matrices can be thought of as transformations from one set of basis vectors to another set of basis vectors. Eigenvectors are the directions in the transform that stay along the same parallel, or in other words their transformed value is the same direction, just a different magnitude (including negative). The value by which the magnitude changes is called an eigenvalue.
