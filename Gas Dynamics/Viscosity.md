Viscosity is how much friction a fluid has with itself. 

In aerodynamics, [[Reynolds number]] is a good indicator how big an impact the viscous forces in the fluid will have.

All fluids have a level of viscosity, although in some cases it has a very small effect. In this case, the fluid can be modeled using [[Aerodynamics/Potential Flow/About|Potential Flow]].
