## Overview

Reynolds number is a non-dimensional number to describe the [[Viscosity|viscosity]] in a fluid. It is essentially the magnitude of pressure forces divided by magnitude of viscosity forces. This means that large Reynolds numbers will be pressure dominated while low Reynolds numbers will be viscosity dominated.

All fluid flows are similar with each other, and can be fully described with the mach number and Reynolds number. See AE 305, Tim Smith notes for more information.

## Equation

Re = rho * u * L / mu

where
* rho = density of the fluid
* u = flow speed
* L = characteristic length
* mu = dynamic viscosity of the fluid
