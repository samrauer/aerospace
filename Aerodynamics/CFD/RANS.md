Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes is time averaged equations of motion for fluid flow. This has extra terms in the EOM that flatten out short term fluctuations. This makes it an ideal choice when analyzing a (mostly) smooth body with small amounts of separation and small wakes.

RANS is less computationally intensive than other CFD methods like LES (large eddy simulation) and DNS (direct numerical simulation).
