Software applications can use potential flow equations to get aerodynamic properties about an aircraft. There are different ways to create surfaces in potential flow, but vortex lattice methods are most commonly used.

## AVL

AVL is a program for the aerodynamic and flight-dynamic analysis of rigid aircraft
of arbitrary configuration. It employs an extended vortex lattice model for
the lifting surfaces, together with a slender-body model for fuselages and nacelles.
General nonlinear flight states can be specified. The flight dynamic analysis
combines a full linearization of the aerodynamic model about any flight state,
together with specified mass properties.

## OpenVSP

OpenVSP is a parametric aircraft geometry tool. OpenVSP allows the user to create a 3D model of an aircraft defined by common engineering parameters. This model can be processed into formats suitable for engineering analysis.

Able to roughly model propeller effects. If propeller(s) is in pull configuration, it can have significant effects on aircraft performance.
