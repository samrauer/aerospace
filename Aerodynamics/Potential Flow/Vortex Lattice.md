Vortex lattice methods use discrete vortices to represent panels on a body. The finite vortices create a finite number of equations to solve and get the flow solution.

Each panel on the aircraft can be roughly estimated using a [[Horseshoe vortex|horseshoe vortex]] to enforce flow tangency at the center of the panel.
