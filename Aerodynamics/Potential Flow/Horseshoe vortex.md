A vortex line perpendicular to a flow roughly describes an airfoil's effect on a flow. To capture this in a finite wing, a horseshoe vortex can be used.

A horseshoe vortex is a vortex line that sits at the quarter-chord location of the wing and at the tips, the vortex line changes directions to be directly downstream. 

Helmholtz's second theorem states that a vortex line cannot end abruptly, therefore vortex lines must either extend to infinity or form closed loops. The finite wing holds the vortex line in place, then the vortex line follows the freestream. The vortex line strength, gamma, will be constant everywhere along the line.
