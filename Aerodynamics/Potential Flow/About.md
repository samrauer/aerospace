Potential flow equations describe inviscid flow (and as a result irrotational flow). Both compressible and non-compressible flow can be modeled with potential flow.

When creating a body using potential flow, only the outside flow is valid. The flow generated inside the body and outside of boundaries should not be considered in the solution.
